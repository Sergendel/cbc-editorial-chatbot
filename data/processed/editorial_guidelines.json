        "Children and Youth: Interviews": "The participation of children (15 and younger) and youth (16 or 17) in our programs and content entails special challenges. Children and youth do not necessarily have the experience to weigh the consequences of publication of their statements. They nevertheless enjoy freedom of expression and the right to information. Their realities and concerns cannot be fully reflected without being heard in our reporting. Parents or those exercising parental authority are often the guardians of this balance and we generally respect their judgment in this regard. However, in some cases a parent can abuse his or her authority and fail to act in the best interest of the child or youth. There are also other circumstances where it may be appropriate to allow children and youth to exercise their good judgment about granting an interview or otherwise participating in our programming or content, for instance when no foreseeable inconvenience or detrimental consequences for them or their family could ensue. We carefully assess the impacts according to the specifics of each situation. We respect the will of the child or youth and we put his or her interests foremost.",
        "Protection of Youth": "We should be aware that provincial laws on the protection of children and families generally include restrictions on publication of information about children or youth who are in care of the State, or who are involved with the justice system.",
        "Respect for young audiences": "Our obligations as a broadcast licensee include a commitment to refrain from broadcasting programs containing adult situations, scenes of violence or those that are sexually explicit before the “watershed” hour of 9 p.m. There are times some programs, newscasts or online content not reserved for adult consumption contain material unsuitable for young children. We will broadcast an audience advisory before the program, segments or other material is shown or appears on the website.",
        "Children and social media": "We take care to protect the privacy of children involved in the use of social media. We are especially careful to assess the impacts when dealing with those aged 15 and under, who may lack the judgment required to consent to interviews and publication of their information. We avoid providing information that could identify them because this puts them at risk from online predators. When contacting children through their Facebook or other public sites, we follow the standards set for children’s participation applicable to all other platforms."

        },
        "Handling of Complaints": "When a complaint is made against information published or broadcast by CBC (whether an in-house production or a report or documentary produced by a third party), and the Ombudsman has decided it warrants a response, senior programmers or management undertake to reply promptly. If the Ombudsman has indicated that the complaint is reviewable, and the complainant is not satisfied with the explanations given, the Ombudsman conducts a review, which will be published publicly. CBC undertakes to make the Ombudsman’s opinion accessible by, among other means, posting a link on an appropriate web page – for example, on a program page or a landing page.",
        "Removal of Content": "Because much online material remains accessible indefinitely, we receive requests to remove stories by audience members who are either principals in stories, or are affected by them. We generally do not agree to requests to remove published material from our web pages. Our published content is a matter of public record. To change the content of previously published material alters that record. Altering the record could undermine our credibility and the public’s trust in our journalism. There can be exceptions to this position – where there are legal or personal safety considerations to the person named. Any decision to remove content is exceptional and is made by the Director. There are other remedies to consider; correcting inaccuracies or updating a story to provide details about its resolution can often address requests for deletion."

        },
        "Consumer Information: Principles": "Consumer information programs are intended to help consumers make informed choices of goods and services or to show how to solve certain problems. This is consistent with the mandate to inform citizens so that they may make decisions on public issues. The conclusions set out in this kind of reporting are based on thorough research and not on personal opinion. Research for such programming will be meticulous and will be carried out as much as possible in consultation with competent organizations and specialists.",
        "Research Protocols": "Journalists exploring a subject are often confronted with facts or interpretations that require confirmation by more formal research – laboratory testing, surveys, focus-group interviewing, etc. This type of study should be carried out in accordance with basic rules of research or with the support of credible, independent institutions or experts. Any proposal to test products and services will be submitted for approval to the Director. In the case of research by polling and focus groups, the protocols will be developed in consultation with the CBC Research Department and are submitted for approval to the Director.",
        "Product Testing": "Our programs sometimes use specialized experts and/or laboratories to test products and services. Before publishing results, we consult with the Director to consider whether additional verification or testing is appropriate. We will strive to present to the public an overview of the methodology used, as well as the name of the laboratory and/or experts involved.",
        "Clandestine Methods: Principles": "In journalism, clandestine methods include: recording a scene or statements with hidden technical devices; conducting an interview without first identifying oneself as a journalist; asking someone else to gather information on our behalf using any of these methods; and using concealment techniques when we gather digital information. Since we are aware that unwarranted use of clandestine methods could impair the credibility of our reporting, we will ascertain beforehand that the method chosen clearly serves the public interest and is lawful. We will consult appropriate editorial management on the method we propose to use and its purpose; as well, whether material will be gathered mainly for research on the subject or for publication in our report.",
        "Hidden Cameras and Microphones: Justification for Recording": "We will hide our recording equipment only in circumstances where we believe it would be difficult or impossible to gather the information by acting more openly. We will consult with the Managing Editor before undertaking clandestine recordings. Public places: We may choose to conceal our recording equipment in a public place – anywhere the public has unrestricted access – to record behavior that is a matter of public interest and that the presence of the camera might alter. We may also choose to do so where a hostile crowd or individuals threaten the safety of journalists so that our ability to do our work would be hindered. Private places: Before bringing hidden recording equipment into private spaces, to which access is restricted, we will ensure the following: We will consult with the Managing Editor to confirm our assessment of the situation, and will take care to comply with legal restrictions before undertaking clandestine recordings in private places.",
        "Hidden Cameras and Microphones: Justification of Publication of Material Gathered": "Clandestinely recorded material will be carefully evaluated. Any proposed broadcast or online posting of a clandestine recording must be approved by the Director. The following are examples where clandestine recording and publication of material could be warranted: Material recorded in a public place: Material gathered in a public place to illustrate behaviour, attitudes or reactions that would otherwise be impossible to document. We will ensure that the editing of the material results in a faithful representation of the reality being reported. We will also take into account certain concepts specific to Quebec civil law, such as the right to one’s likeness, and ensure, in consultation with the Law Department when in doubt, that we properly understand the scope of these concepts and how they apply in specific cases. Material illustrating an illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust: If selected excerpts of the material gathered reveal illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust, we will attempt to confront the person exposed in the clandestine recording and will take his or her reaction into account in our report. Clandestine recording by a third party: Sometimes a person outside CBC provides a recording made without the knowledge of one or more of the persons recorded. We first and foremost seek to verify that the recording was made lawfully. We will also seek to verify its authenticity. We will ensure that the editing of the material results in a faithful representation of the reality being reported on. If the recording reveals illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust or contains information of public interest, its publication in whole or in part may be warranted, provided we have attempted to confront the persons recorded and have taken their reactions into account in our report. Publication of a clandestine recording provided by a third party requires Director approval.",
        "Concealment of Identity as a Journalist": "We generally practice our reporting openly. However, there are times, while investigating a matter of public interest, a reporter will conceal his or her occupation and true purpose and pose as an ordinary citizen. We will consult with the Director before doing so. Our overriding priority will be sound public service journalism. Whatever the means used to contact a source without identifying oneself as a journalist (in person, by telephone, by email, through social networks), we will attempt to confront the source and take his or her reaction into account in our report. When the investigation bears on illegal or antisocial behaviour or abuse of trust and the gathering of information of public interest, the journalist may need to infiltrate an organization to get first-hand information. We take into account possible safety issues for the journalist involved. Before resorting to infiltration we will ensure that the following conditions are met: Any plan to infiltrate will be submitted to the Director for prior approval.",
        "Intercepting Conference Calls": "We respect the privacy of individuals, groups and organizations when they conduct conversations via conference calls. As a rule, we do not attempt to hack in, or listen in without being openly invited to participate in a conference call. However, if a participant on the call offers to share the information after the fact, the principles for our treatment of sources would guide our use of the material. We may consider listening in or recording without the knowledge of all the participants, if all the following conditions have been met: If the conference call was recorded, the use of the recording on air or online is subject to the conditions set in Hidden Cameras and Microphones – Justification of Publication of Material Gathered.",
        "Responsibility and Accountability Related to Interviews": "CBC takes responsibility for the consequences of its decision to publish a person’s statements in the context it chooses. When we present a person’s statements in support of our reporting of facts, we ensure that the statements have been diligently checked. In the case of comments made by a person expressing an honest opinion, we ensure that the opinion is grounded in facts bearing on a matter of public interest. The interviewee also takes responsibility for his or her statement. As a general rule, we offer the interviewee no immunity or protection from the consequences of publication of the statements we gather.",
        "Identification of Interviewees": "We are open and straightforward when we present interviewees and their statements. We make every effort to disclose the identity of interviewees and to give the context and explanations necessary for the audience to judge the relevance and credibility of their statements. In exceptional cases and for serious cause, we may decide to withhold such information in whole or in part. In such cases we explain the situation to the audience without disclosing the information that must be kept secret.",
        "Conduct and Use of Interviews": "We inform proposed interviewees of the subject of the interview. As a general rule, if the person is scheduled to give an interview for broadcast, we do not provide in advance the questions they will be asked. That could give a false impression of spontaneity in the interviewee’s responses and unduly limit the interviewer’s ability to react to interviewee statements with supplementary questions. However, if the only way to gather information is via emails or social media, this context should be disclosed when the content is used. We advise the interviewee of how we plan to use the interview. When an interview is recorded, it may be edited before publication for length or to select the relevant passages. At our discretion, we may choose to rebroadcast an interview in whole or in part, post it online or make it accessible in website archives, or not be published at all. Whatever the context in which we choose to use the content of the interview, we will respect the meaning of an interviewee’s statements. We try to avoid situations where prior restraint would be agreed to or imposed. If, for serious cause, we do agree to restrict the use that may be made of an interview, we take the necessary measures to comply with this commitment. It may be necessary to explain to the audience that such restrictions have been agreed to, so the public can assess the credibility of the interviewee’s statements.",
        "Remuneration of Interviewees": "We do not pay people for interviews used in our reporting. Nor do we pay people for eyewitness accounts or answering our questions about events in which they participated. That would compromise the credibility of our reporting. It may be acceptable to reimburse certain legitimate expenses incurred by the interviewee in order to be available for the interview. If substantial expenses are involved, the proposal is referred to the Director. Payment of fees at recognized rates to experts or commentators is current practice and acceptable where the person comments on news or current affairs and adds context to our content without being an actor in the event or issue. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. We may also be required to pay royalties for the broadcast or reproduction of copyrighted work such as photos, video recordings, audio recordings, drawings or other material that may be relevant to an interviewee’s statements. This does not constitute payment to a source. We do not pay politicians, their representatives or other holders of public office for participating in our broadcasts, news bulletins, reporting or online content. In addition, the law governing federal MPs and senators prohibits them from receiving any payment whatever from CBC, including reimbursements of expenses, fees or royalties), because of its status as a federal Crown corporation.",
        "Statements Recorded Outside a Formal Interview": "In the period leading up to or following an interview proper, an interviewee may make statements that are recorded and that may be pertinent to report. In such cases we inform the interviewee of our intention to make public the statements he or she made outside the formal interview and we take into account the explanations or context the interviewee may provide to us. If the interviewee objects to publication of this part of the recording, we carefully weigh the public interest of reporting the statements anyway, with consideration for the interviewee’s arguments and the effect of such a decision on the perception of the public and of potential CBC interviewees. The decision should be discussed with the Managing Editor. If we publish statements made outside a formal interview, we explain to the audience the conditions under which they were recorded. It may happen in connection with a live broadcast that statements are picked up and broadcast without the interviewee’s being aware that he or she is on the air. Depending on the nature of the statements broadcast, it may be appropriate to give the interviewee an opportunity to clarify his or her thought or explain such statements, especially if they could cause prejudice.",
        "Interviews Without Consent": "We generally respect a person’s refusal to be interviewed. However, in the public interest we may choose to disregard the refusal, especially in investigative reporting or when a person plays a key role in an event. In such cases, we first try to persuade the person to be interviewed. If he or she continues to refuse and we consider it essential to record his or her reaction to our questions, we may confront the person, identify ourselves as CBC journalists, and record for broadcast his or her statements without obtaining consent. A decision to confront a person who has refused an interview will be discussed in advance with the Managing Editor, as will a decision whether to conceal the camera in such an instance. If the camera is concealed, we ask the Director before broadcasting. We resort to this form of interview in the public interest, not simply for stylistic effect. When we suspect a person of criminal activity or of obvious abuse, contacting this person to arrange an interview may cause that person to flee. We may then consider it necessary to confront and record this person without prior contact. This exceptional procedure requires prior authorization by the Director. In the case of statements made by telephone, regulatory provisions may restrict the conditions under which they may be published. We will ascertain the specific application of these restrictions and consult editorial management before putting them on air.",
        "Informing the Audience of a Refusal to be Interviewed": "When a person considered necessary to a story refuses to be interviewed or provide comment, in fairness to all parties, we advise the audience of the refusal. When appropriate, we also provide the reasons given.",
        "Editing of an Interview": "Questions and answers can be excerpted from a complete interview for use in a report, intercut with narration, news footage or excerpts from other interviews. Similarly, a longer interview often needs editing to cut unnecessary passages or to fit program timing. Whatever editing we do, we present what the interviewee said fairly and without distortion.",
        "Request for Non-publication": "To preserve our independence, we do not grant veto power to the people we interview. We may publish any material gathered, provided it complies with our journalistic principles and standards. However, we undertake to seriously consider a request for non-publication. We may decide not to publish the material gathered, for instance where: Requests for non-publication are referred to the Managing Editor.",
        "Reply": "A person may consider that he or she has been wronged by one of our reports and request that we publish his or her reply. Canadian law does not grant right of reply and CBC reserves full editorial authority over the content of all its platforms. However, if the complaint raises new facts and that we believe these facts would impact the accuracy, fairness or balance of the main points of view featured in our report, we will ensure that this information is brought to the attention of our audiences.",
        "Censorship and Hindrance of Freedom of the Press": "We advise our audience if we are required to submit an interview to a government, judicial or military authority for clearance, whether or not the material was censored. We will do the same if our work is hindered or controlled in whole or in part by an exercise of authority or by threats, violence or intimidation affecting the quality of the information we are able to communicate.",
        "Children and Youth: Interviews": "The participation of children (15 and younger) and youth (16 or 17) in our programs and content entails special challenges. Children and youth do not necessarily have the experience to weigh the consequences of publication of their statements. They nevertheless enjoy freedom of expression and the right to information. Their realities and concerns cannot be fully reflected without being heard in our reporting. Parents or those exercising parental authority are often the guardians of this balance and we generally respect their judgment in this regard. However, in some cases a parent can abuse his or her authority and fail to act in the best interest of the child or youth. There are also other circumstances where it may be appropriate to allow youths to exercise their good judgment about granting an interview or otherwise participating in our programming or content, for instance when no foreseeable inconvenience or detrimental consequences for them or their family could ensue. We carefully assess the impacts according to the specifics of each situation. We respect the will of the child or youth and we put his or her interests foremost."

        },
        "Corrections and Clarifications: Principles": "We make every effort to avoid errors on the air and online. In keeping with principles of accuracy, integrity and fairness, we correct a significant error when we have been able to establish that one has occurred. This is essential for our credibility with Canadians. When a correction is necessary, it is made promptly given the circumstances, with due regard for the reach of the published error. The fact that a situation has evolved so that information that was accurate at the time of its publication is no longer accurate does not mean that an error was committed, but we must consider the appropriateness of updating it, taking into account its importance and impact. In some cases, material isn’t inaccurate per se, but risks misleading the audience. In such cases we can consider publishing or airing a clarification. The form and timing of a correction or clarification will be decided by a senior newsroom or program manager. In the most serious cases, a proposed course of action will be referred to the Director, who will among other factors consider the legal implications. In many cases the program or platform on which the error was broadcast or published is best placed to broadcast or publish the correction. But the choice of place to broadcast or publish the correction will depend on the importance of the error and the seriousness of its consequences. When we make corrections and clarifications online, we should include on the story page an explanatory note to the audience.",
        "Correcting Archived Online Material": "In the world of digital on demand, material may be accessible long after its original publication or broadcast. A dated story is not necessarily wrong. It is a reflection of the facts known at the time of publication. It can be an important part of the historical record. To change the content of previously published material alters that record, and could undermine our credibility as well as the public’s trust in our journalism. But there may be times, in the light of new information, that archived material is substantially wrong. In those cases we review the material and take appropriate action that could include revising the original material, including a correction box or writing a fresh story. Any changes to the original material will be noted to preserve the transparency of the process. The decision to alter a story or its status should be made by the Managing Editor, preferably in consultation with the journalist involved.",
        "Removal of Content": "Because much online material remains accessible indefinitely, we receive requests to remove stories by audience members who are either principals in stories, or are affected by them. We generally do not agree to requests to remove published material from our web pages. Our published content is a matter of public record. To change the content of previously published material alters that record. Altering the record could undermine our credibility and the public’s trust in our journalism. There can be exceptions to this position – where there are legal or personal safety considerations to the person named. A decision to remove content would be an extremely exceptional case and should be referred to the Director, or the senior manager of the programming area whose page is involved. They will, among other factors, consider the legal implications. There are other remedies to consider; correcting inaccuracies or updating a story to provide details about its resolution can often address requests for deletion."

        },
        "Principles": "Citizens have the right to know how the state is discharging its responsibility to enforce the law and help suppress crime. Citizens have an interest in knowing how safe their environment is. Our mission to serve the public interest includes rigorous scrutiny of the work of police and courts. In doing so we help ensure the openness on which the legitimacy of these institutions rests.",
        "Constraints Imposed by Law": "We take care not to compromise the proper course of ongoing or potential legal proceedings and to take into account the presumption of innocence enjoyed by every person accused of a crime. In many situations the law imposes restrictions such as publication bans, sealing of documents and closed-door proceedings. Such orders are sometimes automatic or sometimes issued in the course of a proceeding. Reporters have a duty to inform themselves of the existence and nature of these orders and to understand their scope. A decision to challenge a court order must be referred to the Director, in consultation with the Law Department.",
        "Identification of Persons Involved in Legal Proceedings": "Suspects and people accused of offences: Before charges are laid, we carefully weigh the public interest against the consequences to a reputation before disclosing the identity of a suspect in a police investigation. In assessing the public interest, we consider the importance of contributing to openness in the administration of justice, in particular when a suspect is arrested, when a search warrant is executed or in the course of any other court proceeding. A decision to publish the identity of a suspect at this stage is referred to the Managing Editor. Parties in a case: In principle, and unless forbidden by law, identification of persons involved in a case (accused, party in a civil case, witness, attorney, judge) contributes to the openness of legal proceedings and serves the public interest. In some circumstances we will be required by law or court order to refrain, at least for a time, from publishing the name or identity of certain persons involved. We might also choose not to publish the name of an especially vulnerable person involved if his or her identity is not essential to an understanding of the facts. Victims: The victim of a crime is generally named in the charge laid and this information is public. Prior to charges being laid, we may choose to publish the name or otherwise identify a crime victim, even though the information is not yet of a public nature. We may do so if it is in the public interest, or if the victim is dead or is considered a missing person by the authorities (for instance an Amber Alert) or with the consent of the victim, or of their parents if the crime victim is a child. (See «Children involved in a case».) Publication ban: The law or a court order may, in certain circumstances, ban the publication of any information that could identify a victim, a witness or even an accused. This is generally the case for victims of sex crimes. It is also the case for young accused under the special provisions applicable to crimes committed by young offenders, for their young victims and for young witnesses in the case. In reporting on cases where a party must not be identified, we will ensure that no information is disclosed that would allow identification by deduction (indirect identification). Children involved in a case: When children are involved in a legal proceeding as witnesses or as victims of an adult accused and their anonymity is not required by law or court order, we do not seek to interview them unless the parents give consent. We avoid revealing their identity if that is not required to understand the facts of the case or the testimony given.",
        "Fair Treatment and Reporting of Outcome of Legal or Disciplinary Proceedings": "When we cover a legal or disciplinary proceeding, we are aware of the importance of reporting its outcome and we treat the persons concerned with dignity. Rigour in coverage requires that we report fairly on the evidence and the claims of the parties involved. If we invite audience members to comment on news from legal proceedings, we strive to ensure that the comments published will not compromise due process. When a suspect or a person accused of an offence has been identified in our reporting, we strive to communicate on at least one of our platforms the outcome of legal or disciplinary proceedings when we become aware of them.",
        "Release of Persons Convicted of Sex Crimes or Violent Crimes": "Persons convicted of sexual assault or other crimes of a sexual or violent nature have a right to rehabilitation. We report on criminal records after carefully assessing the relevance of publishing this information. We consider the specific situation and assess risk to the safety of others against society’s interest in facilitating the convicted person’s return to society at the end of his or her sentence. Before identifying a person released after conviction for a crime of a sexual or violent nature or reporting information on his or her place of residence or place of work, we refer the decision to the Director.",
        "Interviews with Criminals": "Interviews with persons who have been convicted of a crime or who have confessed to a crime must be justified editorially with due regard to the risk of contributing to the glorification of criminal behaviour. Any proposal to interview a criminal about the circumstances of their crime requires approval by the Director.",
        "Respect for the Suffering of Victims and their Family": "In approaching victims or witnesses of tragic events, we carefully weigh both the public interest of full reporting and the need to show compassion and restraint. In such situations we are considerate and we use judgment. We take care not to exert undue pressure on a distressed person for an interview. When images or audio clips could upset part of the audience, we choose them carefully. We limit their use to what is necessary for an understanding of the subject and we provide an audience advisory before use on any of our platforms."

        "Depiction of Violence": "We reflect the reality of the situations we report. We also respect the sensibilities of our viewers, listeners and readers. Scenes of violence and suffering are part of our coverage of wars, disaster, crime and conflict. We respect our audience by assessing the impact of our images according to time of day and the context of the program where such material is appearing. If it is necessary to use graphic images, we will add a warning ahead of their use. We should familiarize ourselves with any laws or regulations about the depiction of violence.",
        "Suicide": "We are sensitive in our handling of suicides, suicide attempts and desperate acts. In particular, we avoid describing the act in detail or illustrating the method, and we consider the risk of glorifying this behaviour or of influencing vulnerable people.",
        "Bomb Threats": "We generally refrain from publishing threats to individuals except where there is significant public interest. We generally refrain from publishing threats to institutions unless the threats or the security measures that ensue involve consequences for the public. A threat of violence received by CBC, such as a bomb threat, must be immediately reported to the police.",
        "Identification of Accident and Crime Victims": "If police have not released the identity of a person who has died as a result of an accident or a crime, we refrain from publishing this information until we have confirmed it. If the immediate family has not been notified, we consider the public interest before identifying the victim.",
        "Disappearances and Amber Alerts": "Disappearances, especially disappearances of children, capture media attention. In these circumstances we play a role by publishing information to facilitate the search for and return of the missing person – notably under the Amber Alert protocol. At the same time, we keep a critical distance and report the facts while treating those involved with consideration. In many Canadian municipalities and regions, CBC has adhered to an Amber Alert protocol for quick, regular and continuing broadcast and publication of information facilitating the search for a missing child who police believe has been abducted and who could be in danger. This information generally includes details identifying the missing child and can be broadcast or posted online while the Amber Alert is in effect. To determine the conditions under which this information is published and the point at which its publication should cease, we refer to the procedures put in place by CBC for deployment of an Amber Alert. If the person is found and charges are laid in connection with the disappearance, we follow the usual rules and practices concerning identification of accused persons, witnesses and victims regardless of their prior identification in broadcasts of publications while the search was ongoing.",
        "Accompanying a Police Patrol": "We sometimes accompany police officers on patrol or in a police operation. Our goal is to inform the public about the way those responsible for law enforcement ensure public safety and administer justice. Law enforcement officers are called upon to intervene in situations where physical violence may occur. They are also required to collect evidence that could incriminate or exonerate an accused at trial. Our presence on a police patrol carries a risk of confusion between the active roles played by law officers in their work and our role as observers. In our job we gather facts to report to the public, not evidence for the administration of justice. There are things officers of the law can do in the course of their duties that we cannot. We would run the risk of trespassing on private property or invading privacy. We do not have the same entry privileges as police officers. Unless we have been directly invited or authorized by the owner or occupant of the premises, we will act with respect for their privacy. Before agreeing to accompany law officers in their work, we ensure that the limits to our involvement are clearly stated. We take care to assess all the risks arising from our presence in the company of law officers and will refer the final decision to take part in this type of operation to the Managing Editor, in consultation with the Law Department. We clearly advise the audience of the limits imposed on us as observers of the facts and take care to respect the privacy and the presumption of innocence of anyone featured in this kind of police reporting."

        "National Emergencies": "From time to time, in cases of national emergency, CBC makes itself available to get important information to Canadians in a timely fashion. The decision to do so rests with Senior Management. We, however, will still continue to conduct our journalism in the usual manner. The fact that CBC is acting in the role of Emergency Broadcaster does not affect journalistic pursuit.",
        "Disappearances and Amber Alerts": "Disappearances, especially disappearances of children, capture media attention. In these circumstances we play a role by publishing information to facilitate the search for and return of the missing person – notably under the Amber Alert protocol. At the same time, we keep a critical distance and report the facts while treating those involved with consideration. In many Canadian municipalities and regions, CBC has adhered to an Amber Alert protocol for quick, regular and continuing broadcast and publication of information facilitating the search for a missing child who police believe has been abducted and who could be in danger. This information generally includes details identifying the missing child and can be broadcast or posted online while the Amber Alert is in effect. To determine the conditions under which this information is published and the point at which its publication should cease, we refer to the procedures put in place by CBC for deployment of an Amber Alert. If the person is found and charges are laid in connection with the disappearance, we follow the usual rules and practices concerning identification of accused persons, witnesses and victims regardless of their prior identification in broadcasts of publications while the search was ongoing."

        },
        "Responsibility and Accountability Related to Interviews": "CBC takes responsibility for the consequences of its decision to publish a person’s statements in the context it chooses. When we present a person’s statements in support of our reporting of facts, we ensure that the statements have been diligently checked. In the case of comments made by a person expressing an honest opinion, we ensure that the opinion is grounded in facts bearing on a matter of public interest. The interviewee also takes responsibility for his or her statement. As a general rule, we offer the interviewee no immunity or protection from the consequences of publication of the statements we gather.",
        "Identification of Interviewees": "We are open and straightforward when we present interviewees and their statements. We make every effort to disclose the identity of interviewees and to give the context and explanations necessary for the audience to judge the relevance and credibility of their statements. In exceptional cases and for serious cause, we may decide to withhold such information in whole or in part. In such cases we explain the situation to the audience without disclosing the information that must be kept secret.",
        "Conduct and Use of Interviews": "We inform proposed interviewees of the subject of the interview. As a general rule, if the person is scheduled to give an interview for broadcast, we do not provide in advance the questions they will be asked. That could give a false impression of spontaneity in the interviewee’s responses and unduly limit the interviewer’s ability to react to interviewee statements with supplementary questions. However, if the only way to gather information is via emails or social media, this context should be disclosed when the content is used. We advise the interviewee of how we plan to use the interview. When an interview is recorded, it may be edited before publication for length or to select the relevant passages. At our discretion, we may choose to rebroadcast an interview in whole or in part, post it online or make it accessible in website archives, or not be published at all. Whatever the context in which we choose to use the content of the interview, we will respect the meaning of an interviewee’s statements. We try to avoid situations where prior restraint would be agreed to or imposed. If, for serious cause, we do agree to restrict the use that may be made of an interview, we take the necessary measures to comply with this commitment. It may be necessary to explain to the audience that such restrictions have been agreed to, so the public can assess the credibility of the interviewee’s statements.",
        "Remuneration of Interviewees": "We do not pay people for interviews used in our reporting. Nor do we pay people for eyewitness accounts or answering our questions about events in which they participated. That would compromise the credibility of our reporting. It may be acceptable to reimburse certain legitimate expenses incurred by the interviewee in order to be available for the interview. If substantial expenses are involved, the proposal is referred to the Director. Payment of fees at recognized rates to experts or commentators is current practice and acceptable where the person comments on news or current affairs and adds context to our content without being an actor in the event or issue. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. We may also be required to pay royalties for the broadcast or reproduction of copyrighted work such as photos, video recordings, audio recordings, drawings or other material that may be relevant to an interviewee’s statements. This does not constitute payment to a source. We do not pay politicians, their representatives or other holders of public office for participating in our broadcasts, news bulletins, reporting or online content. In addition, the law governing federal MPs and senators prohibits them from receiving any payment whatever from CBC, including reimbursements of expenses, fees or royalties), because of its status as a federal Crown corporation.",
        "Statements Recorded Outside a Formal Interview": "In the period leading up to or following an interview proper, an interviewee may make statements that are recorded and that may be pertinent to report. In such cases we inform the interviewee of our intention to make public the statements he or she made outside the formal interview and we take into account the explanations or context the interviewee may provide to us. If the interviewee objects to publication of this part of the recording, we carefully weigh the public interest of reporting the statements anyway, with consideration for the interviewee’s arguments and the effect of such a decision on the perception of the public and of potential CBC interviewees. The decision should be discussed with the Managing Editor. If we publish statements made outside a formal interview, we explain to the audience the conditions under which they were recorded. It may happen in connection with a live broadcast that statements are picked up and broadcast without the interviewee’s being aware that he or she is on the air. Depending on the nature of the statements broadcast, it may be appropriate to give the interviewee an opportunity to clarify his or her thought or explain such statements, especially if they could cause prejudice.",
        "Interviews Without Consent": "We generally respect a person’s refusal to be interviewed. However, in the public interest we may choose to disregard the refusal, especially in investigative reporting or when a person plays a key role in an event of public interest. In such cases, we first try to persuade the person to be interviewed. If he or she continues to refuse and we consider it essential to record his or her reaction to our questions, we may confront the person, identify ourselves as CBC journalists, and record for broadcast his or her statements without obtaining consent. A decision to confront a person who has refused an interview will be discussed in advance with the Managing Editor, as will a decision whether to conceal the camera in such an instance. If the camera is concealed, we ask the Director before broadcasting. We resort to this form of interview in the public interest, not simply for stylistic effect. When we suspect a person of criminal activity or of obvious abuse, contacting this person to arrange an interview may cause that person to flee. We may then consider it necessary to confront and record this person without prior contact. This exceptional procedure requires prior authorization by the Director. In the case of statements made by telephone, regulatory provisions may restrict the conditions under which they may be published. We will ascertain the specific application of these restrictions and consult editorial management before putting them on air.",
        "Informing the Audience of a Refusal to be Interviewed": "When a person considered necessary to a story refuses to be interviewed or provide comment, in fairness to all parties, we advise the audience of the refusal. When appropriate, we also provide the reasons given.",
        "Editing of an Interview": "Questions and answers can be excerpted from a complete interview for use in a report, intercut with narration, news footage or excerpts from other interviews. Similarly, a longer interview often needs editing to cut unnecessary passages or to fit program timing. Whatever editing we do, we present what the interviewee said fairly and without distortion.",
        "Request for Non-publication": "To preserve our independence, we do not grant veto power to the people we interview. We may publish any material gathered, provided it complies with our journalistic principles and standards. However, we undertake to seriously consider a request for non-publication. We may decide not to publish the material gathered, for instance where: Requests for non-publication are referred to the Managing Editor.",
        "Reply": "A person may consider that he or she has been wronged by one of our reports and request that we publish his or her reply. Canadian law does not grant right of reply and CBC reserves full editorial authority over the content of all its platforms. However, if the complaint raises new facts and we believe these facts would impact the accuracy, fairness or balance of the main points of view featured in our report, we will ensure that this information is brought to the attention of our audiences.",
        "Censorship and Hindrance of Freedom of the Press": "We advise our audience if we are required to submit an interview to a government, judicial or military authority for clearance, whether or not the material was censored. We will do the same if our work is hindered or controlled in whole or in part by an exercise of authority or by threats, violence or intimidation affecting the quality of the information we are able to communicate.",
        "Children and Youth: Interviews": "The participation of children (15 and younger) and youth (16 or 17) in our programs and content entails special challenges. Children and youth do not necessarily have the experience to weigh the consequences of publication of their statements. They nevertheless enjoy freedom of expression and the right to information. Their realities and concerns cannot be fully reflected without being heard in our reporting. Parents or those exercising parental authority are often the guardians of this balance and we generally respect their judgment in this regard. However, in some cases a parent can abuse his or her authority and fail to act in the best interest of the child or youth. There are also other circumstances where it may be appropriate to allow youths to exercise their good judgment about granting an interview or otherwise participating in our programming or content, for instance when no foreseeable inconvenience or detrimental consequences for them or their family could ensue. We carefully assess the impacts according to the specifics of each situation. We respect the will of the child or youth and we put his or her interests foremost.",
        "Recording of Conversation or Pre-interview with a Source": "We often record our conversations with information sources or potential guests for note-taking purposes. This is common practice and is generally done openly, but may be done with or without the interviewee’s knowledge. Whether made with or without the source’s knowledge, recordings of conversations or pre-interviews are generally not published. We are aware that publication of this type of material could undermine a source’s confidence in journalists. It could also have legal or regulatory consequences. We accordingly take care to explore all alternatives to publication of this type of material, in keeping with our journalistic values, and will refer to the Director. We will publish it only in cases when it is in the public interest and publication is the best way to ensure the accuracy, fairness and balance of our report. Any proposal to broadcast a recording made without the knowledge of the interviewee is referred to the Director."

We provide Canadians with information when and how they want it, through an evolving range of media.",
                "To serve the public interest": "Our mission is to inform, to reveal, to contribute to the understanding of issues of public interest and to encourage citizens to participate in our free and democratic society.",
                "To reflect diversity": "We are committed to reflecting accurately the range of experiences and points of view of all citizens. All Canadians, of whatever origins, perspectives and beliefs, should feel that our news and current affairs coverage is relevant to them and lives up to our principles.We have a special responsibility to reflect regional and cultural diversity, as well as fostering respect and understanding across regions.",

                "To act responsibly and to be accountable": "We are aware of the impact of our work and are honest with our audiences. We do not hesitate to correct any mistake when necessary nor to follow up a story when a situation changes significantly. We do not plagiarize. The office of the Ombudsman reviews our practices against the standards set out in these policies. We openly provide the public with the means to judge and hold us to account by sharing with it research we may use to measure the quality and standards of our journalism. We manage our resources responsibly. We strive for journalistic excellence and best practices in all of our journalistic endeavours."
            },
            "Our Principles": {
                "description": "",
                "Accuracy": "We seek out the truth in all matters of public interest. We invest our time and our skills to learn, understand and clearly explain the facts to our audience. The production techniques we use serve to present the content in a clear and accessible manner.",
                "Fairness": "In our information gathering and reporting, we treat individuals and organizations with openness and respect. We are mindful of their rights. We treat them even‑handedly.",
                "Balance": "We contribute to informed debate on issues that matter to Canadians by reflecting a diversity of opinion. Our content on all platforms presents a wide range of subject matter and views. On issues of controversy, we ensure that divergent views are reflected respectfully, taking into account their relevance to the debate and how widely held these views are. We also ensure that they are represented over a reasonable period of time.",
                "Impartiality": "We provide professional judgment based on facts and expertise. We do not promote any particular point of view on matters of public debate.",
                "Integrity": "The trust of the public is our most valued asset. We avoid putting ourselves in real or potential conflict of interest. This is essential to our credibility."
            }
        },
        "Scope": "All employees of CBC News, as well as the content they create, must respect the principles of accuracy, fairness, balance, impartiality and integrity as expressed through the Journalistic Standards and Practices (JSP). Employees of other CBC services, and the content they create, may also be obliged to respect all of some of these principles as follows: Employees of Local Services, Radio Talk information programming, or any service involved in the creation of news, current affairs and public affairs content, must respect all of the principles of the JSP. With the exception of fiction and comedy, content produced by other employees which touches on politics, social issues, economics, cultural issues, scientific issues or sports – particularly if the issues are controversial – must respect the principles of accuracy, fairness and balance. User-generated content, when incorporated into information programming, must conform with the principles of the JSP. Moreover, in an election or referendum period, the JSP applies to all content related to the campaign, parties or candidates that is broadcast and published by the CBC, regardless of the department concerned. The Editors in Chief of the French and English Services are responsible for interpreting and applying the JSP and must be consulted in case of doubt by those responsible for general-interest programs and content. When sports, arts or other specialized units prepare news content, they are accountable to the Editor in Chief who has final editorial authority over it. All the above rules apply to non-CBC staff hired or contracted to help in the production of this content during their employment with CBC.",
        "News, Current Affairs and Public Affairs Content Commissioned by CBC and Produced by Third Parties": "The JSP applies to all news, current affairs and public affairs content commissioned by CBC and produced by third parties. A proposal for content that is not fully in compliance should be referred to the Director.",
        "Editorial Responsibility and Upward Referral": "We make ourselves familiar with the contents of the JSP. We apply the JSP to each situation in good faith and according to our best judgement. We keep up with best journalistic practices, share our experiences and ask ourselves questions before making editorial decisions. We refer to senior editorial management any question raising a doubt or any decision that could affect CBC’s credibility, independence or reputation as a provider of high-quality information. Journalistic Standards and Practices specify on occasion that certain matters must be referred to a specific level of management. The employee or manager making an editorial decision is accountable for that decision. Questions of a legal nature may be referred to CBC’s Law Department. The final editorial decision rests with the managers responsible for programs and online content. Many of the standards and practices listed herein are rooted in values outlined by CBC Corporate Policies. Employees governed by the Journalistic Standards and Practices should consult and be familiar with these policies.",
        "Partnerships and Funding": "We maintain editorial independence and control over our journalistic content. The use of outside funding cannot influence that content or create the perception that the funding body or partner has any influence. If content is produced using external funding, that fact will be disclosed to the audience. Staff wanting to use outside funding to create news content or programming – including from an NGO, federal agency or professional scholarship or fellowship – will seek prior approval from the Director. There are times where for business or philanthropic purposes the CBC itself engages in partnerships with outside entities. News coverage cannot be a condition of such partnerships. If there is news coverage, it should respect the JSP, and be done in such a way that journalists involved are not endorsing an event or a product. These conditions apply as well to productions acquired by CBC. If there are any funding relationships or conditions attached, they must be fully disclosed to CBC in writing.",
        "Publicity and Advertising": "CBC does not allow sponsors to use commercial time to run information programming they have created. We are responsible for all information programming, no matter where it is placed on the schedule. CBC’s credibility and brand as an information provider must never be compromised. Information content may be accompanied by advertising or promotion. However, we do not commercially exploit the brand of our information programs and content in any way detrimental to our independence, credibility or integrity as a public service. This means that CBC's journalistic staff do not prepare or present any paid advertising content. Ads should be clearly defined in appearance and placement so that the public does not confuse them with CBC news content.",
        "Brand protection: fiction": "Any proposal to have journalists simulate their work in fiction, parody or advertising must be referred to the General Manager and Editor in Chief."
    },
    "Investigative Journalism": {
        "metadata": {
            "original_url": "https://cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/vision/governance/journalistic-standards-and-practices/investigative-journalism",
            "timestamp": "2025-05-29T15:24:57.593786"
        },
        "Unique Features of Investigative Journalism": "Investigative journalism is a specific genre of reporting which can lead to conclusions and, in some cases, strong editorial judgments. A journalistic investigation is usually based on a premise but we do not broadcast an investigative report until we have ensured that the facts and evidence support the conclusions and judgments. To achieve fairness, we diligently attempt to present the point of view of the person or institution being investigated.",
        "Double Sourcing": "Our commitment to accuracy and integrity means we try where possible to verify the information with a second source. And there may be times when more than two sources are required. Our stories are based on information we have verified. Wherever possible, our stories use first-hand, identifiable sources – participants in an event or authenticated documents. The importance of second sourcing is influenced by the nature and quality of the primary source. If the primary source is confidential, we will, to the best of our ability, attempt to verify the accuracy of the information through independent corroboration. We will refer any decision to publish a story based on a single confidential source to the Director.",
        "Payment to Sources": "To ensure we maintain our independence, we do not pay for information from a source in a story. However, payment of fees at recognized rates to specialists for an expert report or a scientific analysis is acceptable. This is not chequebook journalism. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. Increasingly, audience members are becoming contributors; providing photos or footage of news events. As CBC does pay for freelance content, it may be appropriate, in rare circumstances, to pay for authenticated content. A decision to do so must be referred to the Director.",
        "Recording of Conversation or Pre-interview with a Source": "We often record our conversations with information sources or potential guests for note-taking purposes. This is common practice and is generally done openly, but may be done with or without the interviewee’s knowledge. Whether made with or without the source’s knowledge, recordings of conversations or pre-interviews are generally not published. We are aware that publication of this type of material could undermine a source’s confidence in journalists. It could also have legal or regulatory consequences. We accordingly take care to explore all alternatives to publication of this type of material, in keeping with our journalistic values, and will refer to senior editorial management. We will publish it only in cases when it is in the public interest and publication is the best way to ensure the accuracy, fairness and balance of our report. Any proposal to broadcast a recording made without the knowledge of the interviewee is referred to the Director.",
        "Agreements with Sources": "Our stories are based on information we have verified. Wherever possible, our stories use first-hand, identifiable sources – participants in an event or authenticated documents. Before we agree to any conditions that would limit our use of information, we are explicit about what those conditions are. We also come to agreement with the source before the information is shared. We can agree to talk to a source “off the record”, which means information cannot be used in a published form, nor can the source be named. We can also agree to publish information from a source, but without identifying that source, in one of two ways:",
        "Protection of Sources – Granting Confidentiality": "Our ability to protect sources allows people with important information to come forward and expose matters of public interest. If we do not properly protect our confidential sources, potential sources will not trust us. This compromises our ability to expose abuses of power. We offer protection to sources based on such factors as: the potential impact and importance of the information on the lives of Canadians and its potential influence on public policy. We also consider the extent of personal or professional hardship and possible danger the source may face if his/her identity becomes known. We must make efforts to establish the source’s credibility and/or find means to corroborate the information. Once we have undertaken to protect a source, we ensure no details that could lead to identification are revealed. We are careful in the use of research material. We use the best technical tools to hide an identity for broadcast. Whenever confidentiality is granted, both the journalist and the source must be fully aware that this commitment extends to CBC as well, and is not merely limited to the journalist granting it. There may be legal implications in granting protection. Journalists should be familiar with relevant regulation or seek legal guidance. Before a confidential source is used in a story or a story is published based on the information provided, the Managing Editor must be told who the source is, and what the agreement entails. Disclosure of sources within the journalistic line of responsibility should not be confused with public disclosure of sources. Seniority of required approvals will depend upon the scope and scale of the story and its potential impact on people or institutions.",
        "Identification of Interviewees": "We are open and straightforward when we present interviewees and their statements. We make every effort to disclose the identity of interviewees and to give the context and explanations necessary for the audience to judge the relevance and credibility of their statements. In exceptional cases and for serious cause, we may decide to withhold such information in whole or in part. In such cases we explain the situation to the audience without disclosing the information that must be kept secret.",
        "Use of Leaked Documents": "Leaked documents from known or anonymous sources can provide important research for a story. When we receive leaked documents, we verify the authenticity, corroborate the information they contain, and carefully assess the motives of the person who leaked them. There are also times when the content of the documents or the fact of their existence is an important part of the story. If we have agreed to protect the identity of the person who has provided the material, we are careful that the publication of the leaked documents does not inadvertently identify the source. There may be national security or legal issues attached to the possession and publication of some leaked documents. We will take these issues into account and seek legal advice. The decision to publish leaked documents raising legal or national security concerns is referred to the General Manager and Editor in Chief.",
        "Embargos": "Persons or organizations preparing to publish the results of research or investigations will often offer us privileged access to the conclusions of their report on condition that we undertake to publish nothing of the shared content before a date set by the report’s author. This is called receiving information under embargo. A commitment to comply with the embargo may also have been made by a news agency that provides us with articles identified as embargoed. Our policy is to fulfill our embargo commitments. Prior access to a study report allows us to better prepare our reports and to do rigorous reporting work on the results, and is thus a net benefit to the quality of information we publish. Also, we need to keep our word in order to keep information flowing from our sources. However, if the embargo is violated by another media organization, we may consider publication after consulting editorial management and after informing the organization that asked for the embargo. We will inform them that the embargo has been broken and that we intend in turn to go public with the information. If we have already obtained information covered by the material under embargo, we will avoid agreeing to an embargo and will publish the information according to our own criteria of newsworthiness and at the time we consider appropriate.",
        "Verification of User Generated Content in News Stories": "CBC is responsible for all content on its news sites. This policy covers text, image, video or audio contributions from the public which are incorporated into news coverage on any platform. Material that originates from a non-CBC source is clearly identified as such. Before text, image, video or audio is published, we try to verify the information with a second source. There may be times when a third source is required. We are clear with the audience about what we do and do not know. This could include explaining the user’s relationship to the events. In exceptional circumstances, it may be difficult to authenticate a contribution. There may be times where because of timeliness or as a matter of public interest, we decide to publish without full verification.The decision to publish material without full authentication must be referred to the Managing Editor. We should disclose such decisions to the audience.",
        "Clandestine Methods: Principles": "In journalism, clandestine methods include: recording a scene or statements with hidden technical devices; conducting an interview without first identifying oneself as a journalist; asking someone else to gather information on our behalf using any of these methods; and using concealment techniques when we gather digital information. Since we are aware that unwarranted use of clandestine methods could impair the credibility of our reporting, we will ascertain beforehand that the method chosen clearly serves the public interest and is lawful. We will consult appropriate editorial management on the method we propose to use and its purpose, whether material will be gathered mainly for research on the subject or for publication in our report.",
        "Hidden Cameras and Microphones: Justification for Recording": "We will hide our recording equipment only in circumstances where we believe it would be difficult or impossible to gather the information by acting more openly. We will consult with the Managing Editor before undertaking clandestine recordings. Public places: We may choose to conceal our recording equipment in a public place – anywhere the public has unrestricted access – to record behavior that is a matter of public interest and that the presence of the camera might alter. We may also choose to do so where a hostile crowd or individuals threaten the safety of journalists so that our ability to do our work would be hindered. Private places: Before bringing hidden recording equipment into private spaces, to which access is restricted, we will ensure the following: We will consult with the Managing Editor to confirm our assessment of the situation, and will take care to comply with legal restrictions before undertaking clandestine recordings in private places.",
        "Hidden Cameras and Microphones: Justification of Publication of Material Gathered": "Clandestinely recorded material will be carefully evaluated. Any proposed broadcast or online posting of a clandestine recording must be approved by a Director. The following are examples where clandestine recording and publication of material could be warranted: Material recorded in a public place: Material gathered in a public place to illustrate behaviour, attitudes or reactions that would otherwise be impossible to document. We will ensure that the editing of the material results in a faithful representation of the reality being reported. We will also take into account certain concepts specific to Quebec civil law, such as the right to one’s likeness, and ensure, in consultation with the Law Department when in doubt, that we properly understand the scope of these concepts and how they apply in specific cases. Material illustrating an illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust: If selected excerpts of the material gathered reveal illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust, we will attempt to confront the person exposed in the clandestine recording and will take his or her reaction into account in our report. Clandestine recording by a third party: Sometimes a person outside CBC provides a recording made without the knowledge of one or more of the persons recorded. We first and foremost seek to verify that the recording was made lawfully. We will also seek to verify its authenticity. We will ensure that the editing of the material results in a faithful representation of the reality being reported on. If the recording reveals illegal or antisocial activity or an abuse of trust or contains information of public interest, its publication in whole or in part may be warranted, provided we have attempted to confront the persons recorded and have taken their reactions into account in our report. Publication of a clandestine recording provided by a third party requires Director approval.",
        "Concealment of identity as Journalist": "We generally practice our reporting openly. However, there are times, while investigating a matter of public interest, a reporter will conceal his or her occupation and true purpose and pose as an ordinary citizen. We will consult with the Director before doing so. Our overriding priority will be sound public service journalism. Whatever the means used to contact a source without identifying oneself as a journalist (in person, by telephone, by email, through social networks), we will attempt to confront the source and take his or her reaction into account in our report. When the investigation bears on illegal or antisocial behaviour or abuse of trust and the gathering of information of public interest, the journalist may need to infiltrate an organization to get first-hand information. We take into account possible safety issues for the journalist involved. Before resorting to infiltration we will ensure that the following conditions are met: Any plan to infiltrate will be submitted to the Director for prior approval.",
        "Data Journalism": "Many organizations share data with the public through websites and online databases. Our Journalistic Standards and Practices apply to journalists, developers and programmers who gather, analyze, visualize and report on this data. Web scrapers can be used as a way to extract publicly available information from websites in a short time frame. When using web scrapers, we strive to be transparent toward the organization hosting the data. We also take reasonable steps to minimize any performance impact our web scrapers may have on servers and other public users of a website. When we judge it to be in the public interest, we may also decide to use clandestine methods to obtain the data (see chapter Principles – Clandestine methods). This may involve legal considerations. Before doing so, we obtain approval from the Director.",
        "Intercepting Conference Calls": "We respect the privacy of individuals, groups and organizations when they conduct conversations via conference calls. As a rule, we do not attempt to hack in, or listen in without being openly invited to participate in a conference call. However, if a participant on the call offers to share the information after the fact, the principles for our treatment of sources would guide our use of the material. We may consider listening in or recording without the knowledge of all the participants, if all the following conditions have been met : If the conference call was recorded, the use of the recording on air or online is subject to the conditions set in Hidden Cameras and Microphones – Justification of Publication of Material Gathered.",
        "Principles: Privacy": "We exercise our right of access to information and our freedom of expression within the context of individual rights. One of these is the right to privacy. In situations involving personal suffering and pain, we balance the public’s right to know against individual human dignity. We disclose information of a private nature only when the subject matter is of public interest. Without limiting the meaning of public interest, we work in the public interest when we reveal information that helps our audience make decisions about matters of public debate and when we expose illegal activity, anti-social behavior, corruption, abuse of trust, negligence and incompetence, or a situation that poses a risk to the health and safety of others. Some aspects of privacy are protected in law. It varies from province to province or territory; federal statutes cover some areas. CBC journalists must be familiar with the legal aspects of privacy or, when unsure, seek legal guidance.",
        "Use of Private Correspondence": "We do not reveal the content of private correspondence not addressed to us (e-mails, letters or voice mail) unless it is in the public interest to publish the information. We must make every effort to verify that the information is accurate. We allow the person or institution affected to comment on the information we propose to reveal. Where there may be legal considerations, journalists should seek legal advice. A decision to publish private correspondence requires authorization from the Director.",
        "Trespass": "We understand and respect private property. We should be aware of the legal issues of violating private space and seek advice when unsure. The definition of private space is not the same in every province and territory. We usually do not enter private space without obtaining permission from those with authority to provide it. This is different from observing or recording events taking place on private property from a public space. But, we weigh the value and importance of doing so against the principles of privacy as laid out in this section.",
        "Drones": "Sometimes new technologies change the way journalists are able to gather images and information. Use of these technologies generally does not change the way we interpret our standards and practices. One such example is the use of drones. Images captured by cameras attached to drones may violate the principle of respect for privacy. Any capture or dissemination of material involving this principle should be assessed against the public interest in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy standards elsewhere in this document. Where appropriate, we may also refer to provisions for Clandestine Methods. We should be aware of legal regulations concerning the use of drones.",
        "Identification of Accident and Crime Victims": "If police have not released the identity of a person who has died as a result of an accident or a crime, we refrain from publishing this information until we have confirmed it. If the immediate family has not been notified, we consider the public interest before identifying the victim.",
        "Accompanying a Police Patrol": "We sometimes accompany police officers on patrol or in a police operation. Our goal is to inform the public about the way those responsible for law enforcement ensure public safety and administer justice. Law enforcement officers are called upon to intervene in situations where physical violence may occur. They are also required to collect evidence that could incriminate or exonerate an accused at trial. Our presence on a police patrol carries a risk of confusion between the active roles played by law officers in their work and our role as observers. In our job we gather facts to report to the public, not evidence for the administration of justice. There are things officers of the law can do in the course of their duties that we cannot. We would run the risk of trespassing on private property or invading privacy. We do not have the same entry privileges as police officers. Unless we have been directly invited or authorized by the owner or occupant of the premises, we will act with respect for their privacy. Before agreeing to accompany law officers in their work, we ensure that the limits to our involvement are clearly stated. We take care to assess all the risks arising from our presence in the company of law officers and will refer the final decision to take part in this type of operation to the Managing Editor, in consultation with the Law Department. We clearly advise the audience of the limits imposed on us as observers of the facts and take care to respect the privacy and the presumption of innocence of anyone featured in this kind of police reporting.",
        "Responsibility and Accountability Related to Interviews": "CBC takes responsibility for the consequences of its decision to publish a person’s statements in the context it chooses. When we present a person’s statements in support of our reporting of facts, we ensure that the statements have been diligently checked. In the case of comments made by a person expressing an honest opinion, we ensure that the opinion is grounded in facts bearing on a matter of public interest. The interviewee also takes responsibility for his or her statement. As a general rule, we offer the interviewee no immunity or protection from the consequences of publication of the statements we gather.",
        "Conduct and Use of Interviews": "We inform proposed interviewees of the subject of the interview. As a general rule, if the person is scheduled to give an interview for broadcast, we do not provide in advance the questions they will be asked. That could give a false impression of spontaneity in the interviewee’s responses and unduly limit the interviewer’s ability to react to interviewee statements with supplementary questions. However, if the only way to gather information is via emails or social media, this context should be disclosed when the content is used. We advise the interviewee of how we plan to use the interview. When an interview is recorded, it may be edited before publication for length or to select the relevant passages. At our discretion, we may choose to rebroadcast an interview in whole or in part, post it online or make it accessible in website archives, or not be published at all. Whatever the context in which we choose to use the content of the interview, we will respect the meaning of an interviewee’s statements. We try to avoid situations where prior restraint would be agreed to or imposed. If, for serious cause, we do agree to restrict the use that may be made of an interview, we take the necessary measures to comply with this commitment. It may be necessary to explain to the audience that such restrictions have been agreed to, so the public can assess the credibility of the interviewee’s statements.",
        "Remuneration of Interviewees": "We do not pay people for interviews used in our reporting. Nor do we pay people for eyewitness accounts or answering our questions about events in which they participated. That would compromise the credibility of our reporting. It may be acceptable to reimburse certain legitimate expenses incurred by the interviewee in order to be available for the interview. If substantial expenses are involved, the proposal is referred to the Director. Payment of fees at recognized rates to experts or commentators is current practice and acceptable where the person comments on news or current affairs and adds context to our content without being an actor in the event or issue. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. We may also be required to pay royalties for the broadcast or reproduction of copyrighted work such as photos, video recordings, audio recordings, drawings or other material that may be relevant to an interviewee’s statements. This does not constitute payment to a source. We do not pay politicians, their representatives or other holders of public office for participating in our broadcasts, news bulletins, reporting or online content. In addition, the law governing federal MPs and senators prohibits them from receiving any payment whatever from CBC, including reimbursements of expenses, fees or royalties), because of its status as a federal Crown corporation.",
        "Statements Recorded Outside a Formal Interview": "In the period leading up to or following an interview proper, an interviewee may make statements that are recorded and that may be pertinent to report. In such cases we inform the interviewee of our intention to make public the statements he or she made outside the formal interview and we take into account the explanations or context the interviewee may provide to us. If the interviewee objects to publication of this part of the recording, we carefully weigh the public interest of reporting the statements anyway, with consideration for the interviewee’s arguments and the effect of such a decision on the perception of the public and of potential CBC interviewees. The decision should be discussed with the Managing Editor. If we publish statements made outside a formal interview, we explain to the audience the conditions under which they were recorded. It may happen in connection with a live broadcast that statements are picked up and broadcast without the interviewee’s being aware that he or she is on the air. Depending on the nature of the statements broadcast, it may be appropriate to give the interviewee an opportunity to clarify his or her thought or explain such statements, especially if they could cause prejudice.",
        "Interviews Without Consent": "We generally respect a person’s refusal to be interviewed. However, in the public interest we may choose to disregard the refusal, especially in investigative reporting or when a person plays a key role in an event of public interest. In such cases, we first try to persuade the person to be interviewed. If he or she continues to refuse and we consider it essential to record his or her reaction to our questions, we may confront the person, identify ourselves as CBC journalists, and record for broadcast his or her statements without obtaining consent. A decision to confront a person who has refused an interview will be discussed in advance with the Managing Editor, as will a decision whether to conceal the camera in such an instance. If the camera is concealed, we ask the Director before broadcasting. We resort to this form of interview in the public interest, not simply for stylistic effect. When we suspect a person of criminal activity or of obvious abuse, contacting this person to arrange an interview may cause that person to flee. We may then consider it necessary to confront and record this person without prior contact. This exceptional procedure requires prior authorization by the Director. In the case of statements made by telephone, regulatory provisions may restrict the conditions under which they may be published. We will ascertain the specific application of these restrictions and consult editorial management before putting them on air.",
        "Informing the Audience of a Refusal to be Interviewed": "When a person considered necessary to a story refuses to be interviewed or provide comment, in fairness to all parties, we advise the audience of the refusal. When appropriate, we also provide the reasons given.",
        "Editing of an Interview": "Questions and answers can be excerpted from a complete interview for use in a report, intercut with narration, news footage or excerpts from other interviews. Similarly, a longer interview often needs editing to cut unnecessary passages or to fit program timing. Whatever editing we do, we present what the interviewee said fairly and without distortion.",
        "Request for Non-publication": "To preserve our independence, we do not grant veto power to the people we interview. We may publish any material gathered, provided it complies with our journalistic values and standards. However, we undertake to seriously consider a request for non-publication. We may decide not to publish the material gathered, for instance where: Requests for non-publication are referred to the Managing Editor.",
        "Reply": "A person may consider that he or she has been wronged by one of our reports and request that we publish his or her reply. Canadian law does not grant right of reply and CBC reserves full editorial authority over the content of all its platforms. However, if the complaint raises new facts and that we believe these facts would impact the accuracy, fairness or balance of the main points of view featured in our report, we will ensure that this information is brought to the attention of our audiences.",
        "Censorship and Hindrance of Freedom of the Press": "We advise our audience if we are required to submit an interview to a government, judicial or military authority for clearance, whether or not the material was censored. We will do the same if our work is hindered or controlled in whole or in part by an exercise of authority or by threats, violence or intimidation affecting the quality of the information we are able to communicate.",
        "Children and Youth: Interviews": "The participation of children (15 and younger) and youth (16 or 17) in our programs and content entails special challenges. Children and youth do not necessarily have the experience to weigh the consequences of publication of their statements. They nevertheless enjoy freedom of expression and the right to information. Their realities and concerns cannot be fully reflected without being heard in our reporting. Parents or those exercising parental authority are often the guardians of this balance and we generally respect their judgment in this regard. However, in some cases a parent can abuse his or her authority and fail to act in the best interest of the child or youth. There are also other circumstances where it may be appropriate to allow youths to exercise their good judgment about granting an interview or otherwise participating in our programming or content, for instance when no foreseeable inconvenience or detrimental consequences for them or their family could ensue. We carefully assess the impacts according to the specifics of each situation. We respect the will of the child or youth and we put his or her interests foremost.",
        "Children and Social Media": "We take care to protect the privacy of children involved in the use of social media. We are especially careful to assess the impacts when dealing with those aged 15 and under, who may lack the judgment required to consent to interviews and publication of their information. We avoid providing information that could identify them because this puts them at risk from online predators. When contacting children through their Facebook or other public sites, we follow the standards set for children’s participation applicable to all other platforms.",
        "Production: Principles": "Form is important in information programming. Production techniques contribute to the meaning of our content and its impact. They help focus attention and can facilitate understanding. Our use of production techniques is consistent with factual accuracy and fairness in our reporting. This means we make judicious choices when information content is presented with music or visual effects that could affect perception or impact. We are clear and open about the production methods we use, so the audience can put our images, sound and statements in their proper context. We advise the audience of the use of certain techniques, for example the reenactment of a scene, the use of archival material in scenes of current events or the use of clandestine methods.",
        "Form of Reporting on Litigious Subjects": "Pre-recorded material that has undergone a rigorous editorial process is generally the surest way to avoid errors in reports that could be litigious or could prejudice the reputation of a person or an organization.We may also use live on-air reporting provided all the following conditions are met:",
        "Use of Archival Material": "Illustrating a subject often requires the use of visual or audio material that we have not recorded ourselves, such as stock footage. But the use of stock footage and sound in scenes of current events must not give rise to confusion. If there is a risk of misinterpretation, we will advise the audience of the context and/or date of the archives used. The stock footage will not be used in such a way that distorts either the historical or current reality.",
        "Reconstitutions, Simulations and Generic Scenes": "A reenactment of an event must match the reality as closely as possible. When a reenactment is necessary for a proper understanding of the subject, we take care to be factually accurate, using transcriptions, minutes or official documents. We may use a transcript word for word or set the reenactment in the location where the actual scene occurred. To eliminate any risk that the audience will confuse the reenactment with the reality, we will ensure that the audience can clearly identify the reenacted scenes. Other methods of illustrating a subject may attempt to describe a situation in general terms without pretending to be a precisely accurate rendering of reality. Such methods can be used, subject to certain conditions. A simulated scene aims to evoke or give an impression of an event, its protagonists, their actions and the place where the event occurred. A simulated scene is produced and presented in a way that makes clear it is an evocation rather than a precise depiction of reality. If a risk of confusion remains, we advise the audience that the scene is simulated not real. Generic scenes are commonly used in audiovisual production. These are often everyday actions like walking, answering the phone, looking at a document, closing a door. These scenes clearly serve as general illustration and in no way pretend to describe real facts precisely.",
        "Explicit Sexual or Violent Content": "Violence, nudity and sexuality are never presented without good reason. They may be justified when they are important to an understanding of the world we live in. Where they are necessary, we present them without undue exploitation, voyeurism or sensationalism and without trivializing, encouraging or glorifying. We treat painful scenes with discretion and restraint and without prolonging them unduly. When it is necessary to present explicit content that some could find shocking, we provide an audience advisory. The same principles apply to disturbing video/audio on our digital platforms as on our conventional broadcast platforms. We strive to notify audiences in advance of them seeing such material, including – if possible – when it is seen on third-party platforms."

        "Quality and Precision": "CBC is a language model for its audiences. Good usage and accuracy are essential to high quality journalism. Our language should be simple, clear and concrete. Journalistic style is accurate, concise and accessible. Our purpose is to make complex subjects understandable. When specialized or technical vocabulary needs to be used, it is explained and put in a context that makes it easy to understand. The description of facts, however concise, must provide the nuances necessary to ensure that the account is faithful and easy to understand. Clarity is also essential when numbers and statistics are involved. It is essential to avoid confusion and to take care to properly grasp the numbers used. The use of certain highly charged words can undermine credibility and merits special consideration. Language is constantly evolving. We will be attentive to shifts in the meaning of words. We consult language resources and editorial management as needed to grasp the impact of expressions that are open to multiple interpretations and capable of offending some audience members.",
        "Language Level and Good Taste": "We use the language of accessible, articulate everyday speech. We respect and reflect the generally accepted values of society. We are aware that the audiences we address do not all have the same definition of good taste. We choose a tone that will not gratuitously offend audience sensitivities. In particular we avoid swearing and coarse, vulgar, offensive or violent language except where its omission would alter the nature and meaning of the information reported.",
        "Respect and Absence of Prejudice": "Our vocabulary choices are consistent with equal rights. Our language reflects equality of the sexes and we prefer inclusive forms where they are not prohibitively cumbersome. We are aware of our influence on how minorities or vulnerable groups are perceived. We do not mention national or ethnic origin, colour, religious affiliation, physical characteristics or disabilities, mental illness, sexual orientation or age except when important to an understanding of the subject or when a person is the object of a search and such personal characteristics will facilitate identification. We avoid generalizations, stereotypes and any degrading or offensive words or images that could feed prejudice or expose people to hatred or contempt. Criminal matters require special care and precision. When a minority group is referred to, the vocabulary is chosen with care and with consideration for changes in the language.",
        "Words that Shock: Usage and Audience Advisories": "To describe certain realities or report adequately on certain situations, it is sometimes necessary to use expressions or quotations that may be shocking to part of the audience. In these circumstances, we limit ourselves to what is necessary for understanding, we attribute the statements where applicable and we take care to present them in proper context. We ensure that, taking into account the context in which the words are published, they are not likely to expose anyone to hatred or contempt on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or physical or mental disability. We respect the audience’s degree of tolerance, with due regard for society’s generally shared values. When we find it necessary to use words that could shock part of the public, we give a clear audience advisory."

        "Principles": "When news breaks, whether a political development, natural or man-made disaster, accident or an important police operation, we report as quickly as we can as events unfold. Our commitment is to give people the information they need to understand the true risk and dangers in a fluid situation. We undertake to act responsibly in the circumstances and to give people information we have reasonably verified, and to stay away from rumour and speculation. We will sometimes receive conflicting information from credible sources. We may choose to report this, making clear the circumstances of the situation and citing the sources while we work to reconcile the information in light of the reality on the ground.",
        "Riots and Demonstrations": "Protests and demonstrations, and the right to conduct them, are part of the democratic process. By definition, they are organized to attract the public and the media’s attention. But these situations may evolve and result in confrontation, violence or acts of vandalism. In covering these events, the information we provide is as accurate and as timely as possible under the circumstances. In such a fluid situation, there is a commitment on our part to be open about what we know and how we know it. We will sometimes receive conflicting information from credible sources. We may choose to report this, making clear the circumstances of the situation and citing the sources while we work to reconcile the information in light of the reality on the ground. The information we provide helps the audience understand a fluid and chaotic situation, so that it can assess the impact and potential danger. If reporters on one side of a confrontation cannot provide an overview, we ensure the audience receives a broader context in the course of our coverage. Our journalistic independence and credibility is paramount, so our reporting should avoid inflaming or aiding in any way the various sides in a confrontation. We consider the public interest before offering live coverage during a riot or demonstrations. That includes taking into account the possibility of showing scenes of extreme violence. We are also aware that our presence can sometimes in and of itself create a focal point of activity. If CBC staff has exclusive access to a sit-in or demonstration by advance knowledge, a decision to accompany the organizers should be referred to the Managing Editor.",
        "Acts of Protest": "Individuals or small groups sometimes act in ways that cause disruptions or are potentially dangerous – to bystanders and/or themselves. Hunger strikes and sit-ins are examples. Hijacking and hostage-taking are more extreme, and are covered elsewhere. Before providing live coverage of the event, or making direct contact with the principal participants on air, we assess the potential harm and the newsworthiness of the event, including the level of disruption it is causing in the community. The coverage plan flows from that assessment. We take into account that the presence of a camera or microphone can alter the behaviour of the participants. By its nature, an event is being staged to bring attention to someone’s plight or to a matter of public interest. If CBC staff has exclusive access to a sit-in or demonstration by advance knowledge, a decision to accompany the organizers should be referred to the Managing Editor. We may follow the writing conventions of a particular social media platform, as long as our use of those conventions in no way obscures or alters meaning.",
        "Hijacking and Hostage-taking": "The issues around hijacking, hostage-taking and sieges are similar to kidnapping. We are balancing the need to report on the event with the need to prevent harm to innocent people. When we are reporting these events, the potential harm to innocent people is an important consideration. Guided by our concern for their safety, there are many aspects of coverage, especially live coverage, that require careful consideration: There are several situations that may arise in covering hijacking and hostage-taking which require referral to the General Manager and Editor in Chief:",
        "Use of Material from Hateful, Violent or Illegal Organizations": "Our work sometimes brings us in contact with groups or organizations that are hateful or promote violence. In deciding to air offensive material of this kind, we weigh the value of this information to our audience against the offence it might give and the fact that it might provide a platform for its proponents. A decision to air the material should be referred to the Managing Editor.",
        "Depiction of Violence": "We reflect the reality of the situations we report. We also respect the sensibilities of our viewers, listeners and readers. Scenes of violence and suffering are part of our coverage of wars, disaster, crime and conflict. We respect our audience by assessing the impact of our images according to time of day and the context of the program where such material is appearing. If it is necessary to use graphic images, we will add a warning ahead of their use. We should familiarize ourselves with any laws or regulations about the depiction of violence.",
        "Respect for the Suffering of Victims and Their Family": "In approaching victims or witnesses of tragic events, we carefully weigh both the public interest of full reporting and the need to show compassion and restraint. In such situations we are considerate and we use judgment. We take care not to exert undue pressure on a distressed person for an interview. When images or audio clips could upset part of the audience, we choose them carefully. We limit their use to what is necessary for an understanding of the subject and we provide an audience advisory before use on any of our platforms.",
        "Suicide": "We are sensitive in our handling of suicides, suicide attempts and desperate acts. In particular, we avoid describing the act in detail or illustrating the method, and we consider the risk of glorifying this behaviour or of influencing vulnerable people.",
        "Bomb Threats": "We generally refrain from publishing threats to individuals except where there is significant public interest. We generally refrain from publishing threats to institutions unless the threats or the security measures that ensue involve consequences for the public. A threat of violence received by CBC, such as a bomb threat, must be immediately reported to the police.",
        "Identification of Accident and Crime Victims": "If police have not released the identity of a person who has died as a result of an accident or a crime, we refrain from publishing this information until we have confirmed it. If the immediate family has not been notified, we consider the public interest before identifying the victim.",
        "Disappearances and Amber Alerts": "Disappearances, especially disappearances of children, capture media attention. In these circumstances we play a role by publishing information to facilitate the search for and return of the missing person – notably under the Amber Alert protocol. At the same time, we keep a critical distance and report the facts while treating those involved with consideration. In many Canadian municipalities and regions, CBC has adhered to an Amber Alert protocol for quick, regular and continuing broadcast and publication of information facilitating the search for a missing child who police believe has been abducted and who could be in danger. This information generally includes details identifying the missing child and can be broadcast or posted online while the Amber Alert is in effect. To determine the conditions under which this information is published and the point at which its publication should cease, we refer to the procedures put in place by CBC for deployment of an Amber Alert. If the person is found and charges are laid in connection with the disappearance, we follow the usual rules and practices concerning identification of accused persons, witnesses and victims regardless of their prior identification in broadcasts of publications while the search was ongoing.",
        "Accompanying a Police Patrol": "We sometimes accompany police officers on patrol or in a police operation. Our goal is to inform the public about the way those responsible for law enforcement ensure public safety and administer justice.

We do not mention national or ethnic origin, colour, religious affiliation, physical characteristics or disabilities, mental illness, sexual orientation or age except when important to an understanding of the subject or when a person is the object of a search and such personal characteristics will facilitate identification. We avoid generalizations, stereotypes and any degrading or offensive words or images that could feed prejudice or expose people to hatred or contempt. Criminal matters require special care and precision. When a minority group is referred to, the vocabulary is chosen with care and with consideration for changes in the language.",
        "Words that Shock: Usage and Audience Advisories": "To describe certain realities or report adequately on certain situations, it is sometimes necessary to use expressions or quotations that may be shocking to part of the audience. In these circumstances, we limit ourselves to what is necessary for understanding, we attribute the statements where applicable and we take care to present them in proper context. We ensure that, taking into account the context in which the words are published, they are not likely to expose anyone to hatred or contempt on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age or physical or mental disability. We respect the audience’s degree of tolerance, with due regard for society’s generally shared values. When we find it necessary to use words that could shock part of the public, we give a clear audience advisory.",
        "Form of Reporting on Controversial Subjects": "Pre-recorded material that has undergone a rigorous editorial process is generally the surest way to avoid errors in reports that could be litigious or could prejudice the reputation of a person or an organization. We may also use live on-air reporting provided all the following conditions are met:"

        "Expression of Opinion": "Our programs and platforms allow for the expression of a particular perspective or point of view. This content adds public understanding and debate on the issues of the day. When presenting content (programs, program segments, or digital content) where a single opinion or point of view is featured, we ensure that a diversity of perspective is provided across a network or platform and in an appropriate time frame. When we choose to present a single point of view: Our value of impartiality precludes our news and current affairs staff from expressing their personal opinions on matters of controversy on all our platforms.",
        "Designated Opinion Columnist": "On an exceptional basis, the Editor in Chief may also choose to appoint certain journalists as columnists, who have licence to express their opinions. In order to protect the integrity of CBC's journalism, we will restrict the role of such columnists to opinion and commentary, which will be clearly identified.",
        "Commentators and Guests": "CBC, in its programming, over time, provides a wide range of comment and opinion on significant issues. We achieve balance by featuring multiple perspectives and points of view to reflect a diversity of opinion. It is important to mention any association, affiliation or special interest a guest or commentator may have so that the public can fully understand that person’s perspective.",
        "CBC/Radio-Canada News and Current Affairs Employees": "We are guided by the principle of impartiality. We provide our audience with the perspectives, facts and analysis they need to understand an issue or matter of public interest. CBC journalists do not express their own personal opinion because it affects the perception of impartiality and could affect an open and honest exploration of an issue. We maintain the same standards, no matter where we publish – on CBC platforms or in other media outside the CBC.",
        "Analysis": "When appropriate, news and current affairs staff offer reports we refer to as \"analysis\". Here, reporters may make observations and draw conclusions based on facts as well as their own experience and expertise. Their intent is to give the audience insight into the true nature of events, not to be a forum for the personal opinions or preferences of the author.",
        "Audience": "We give our audience members an opportunity to express their opinion in order to enhance our reflection of Canadians’ diverse views and sensibilities. No matter what platform or in what form – online comments, talkback,phone-ins,or digital contributions – this content is separate from our journalism. It is clearly distinguished from journalistic content. However, we exercise journalistic judgment about what we choose to publish and highlight. When making those choices, we take care that the material featured reflects the range of opinion the audience members expressed on an issue.",
        "Point of View Documentaries": "From time to time, we air journalistic documentaries created from a single perspective. We air these point of view journalistic documentaries for some of the following reasons: We label point of view documentaries as such when they are aired. We ensure balance over time by publishing other perspectives and opinions on the same subject in other programs, program segments or platforms. When the subject is highly controversial, we consider scheduling additional programming with alternate opinions, in an appropriate time frame. CBC hosts and journalists do not narrate, participate in or create point of view documentaries. The Director should be consulted before a point of view documentary is procured and aired."

        },
        "Election Coverage": "Canadians expect us to provide a wide range of information and context so that they can make decisions during election and referendum campaigns. We ensure that the facts and analysis we present on issues, candidates and parties are timely, accurate, fair and balanced over the course of the campaign. We give all candidates, parties and issues equitable treatment. This does not necessarily mean equal broadcast time.",
        "CBC Polls": "The CBC assumes responsibility for the methodology and quality of the surveys it commissions. CBC commissions polls to reflect Canadian opinion on important issues of the day. The polls are commissioned, designed and interpreted in consultation with the CBC's Research Department. To help our audience place a poll in context, we provide relevant information about the size of the sample and methodology along with the results. Where appropriate we report the margin of error. CBC journalists should be familiar with accepted industry practices around sample size, reporting and interpreting results. Elections are a time of intense polling. We are mindful of the potential impact on the outcome of the election when reporting results of polls closer to Election Day. We should familiarize ourselves with any legislation regarding the publication of polls in election periods. Because polls are highly specialized, and because their results can have an impact on a public policy debate or the outcome of an election, the commissioning of polls requires the approval of the Editor in Chief in consultation with the CBC Research Department. The final design requires sign-off from the head of research or delegate.",
        "Reporting on Polls (Other than CBC Polls)": "We report polls not commissioned by CBC as long as we can verify that the methodology is reliable. The methodology and interpretation of results of non-CBC polls should be reviewed by the CBC Research Department. To place a poll in context, we provide our audience with relevant information about the methodology including, where applicable, the sample size and the margin of error. We should familiarize ourselves with any legislation regarding the publication of polls in election periods.",
        "Online Surveys": "We sometimes conduct online surveys as a tool of audience engagement. Because these surveys do not fulfill the criteria set out in polling policy, the questions and the results should not be characterized as polls. We report the results by giving the number of votes cast for each option. We do not give the results as a percentage, as we normally do with bona fide polls. If programs refer to online questions, the results are reported in a way that clearly indicates it has no scientific validity and are not meant to represent the accurate range of either public opinion nor the opinion of our audience.",
        "Remuneration of Interviewees": "We do not pay people for interviews used in our reporting. Nor do we pay people for eyewitness accounts or answering our questions about events in which they participated. That would compromise the credibility of our reporting. It may be acceptable to reimburse certain legitimate expenses incurred by the interviewee in order to be available for the interview. If substantial expenses are involved, the proposal is referred to the Director. Payment of fees at recognized rates to experts or commentators is current practice and acceptable where the person comments on news or current affairs and adds context to our content without being an actor in the event or issue. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. We may also be required to pay royalties for the broadcast or reproduction of copyrighted work such as photos, video recordings, audio recordings, drawings or other material that may be relevant to an interviewee’s statements. This does not constitute payment to a source. We do not pay politicians, their representatives or other holders of public office for participating in our broadcasts, news bulletins, reporting or online content. In addition, the law governing federal MPs and senators prohibits them from receiving any payment whatever from CBC, including reimbursements of expenses, fees or royalties), because of its status as a federal Crown corporation.",
        "Planting Questions": "Working closely with sources as we develop and research stories is a valuable and common journalistic technique. When we do so, we must ensure that we remain free from influence of any political, economic or other interest groups or lobbies. Therefore it is not appropriate to supply specific questions to individuals, which then may be publicly raised in a legislative forum or any kind of public inquiry. This could harm the perception of our independence towards these individuals or the groups they represent.",
        "Covering a Story Involving Family Members": "Integrity is one of our journalistic principles. We refrain from any involvement with stories in which a member of our immediate family (including in-laws) has a strong stake. It is the responsibility of the employee to inform his/her supervisor of the potential conflict. In the rare instance that such a conflict is unavoidable, news managers and the employee will develop a protocol to protect the integrity of our journalism.",
        "Free Travel": "Accepting free travel to help in newsgathering, creation of content or for research puts us in a conflict of interest. We do sometimes face situations where there is a public interest to cover a story, and the only means to get there is through an outside organization or individual. Our practice in these situations is to ask for an accounting of costs and to reimburse them. These exceptional circumstances require the approval of the Director. If our travel costs are covered by an outside organization or individual that we could not reimburse, we mention that fact in our coverage.",
        "Embargos": "Persons or organizations preparing to publish the results of research or investigations will often offer us privileged access to the conclusions of their report on condition that we undertake to publish nothing of the shared content before a date set by the report’s author. This is called receiving information under embargo. A commitment to comply with the embargo may also have been made by a news agency that provides us with articles identified as embargoed. Our policy is to fulfill our embargo commitments. Prior access to a study report allows us to better prepare our reports and to do rigorous reporting work on the results, and is thus a net benefit to the quality of information we publish. Also, we need to keep our word in order to keep information flowing from our sources. However, if the embargo is violated by another media organization, we may consider publication after consulting editorial management and after informing the organization that asked for the embargo. We will inform them that the embargo has been broken and that we intend in turn to go public with the information. If we have already obtained information covered by the material under embargo, we will avoid agreeing to an embargo and will publish the information according to our own criteria of newsworthiness and at the time we consider appropriate."

        },
        "Principles": "We apply the same set of policies and practices to online and digital journalism as we do to any news and information content created by CBC. We are aware that we perform in an online and digital space that provides unfiltered information and uncensored opinion. We stand out by our commitment to all our values. We will be active participants in the online space, and will always be clear about where material comes from, and whether it is news, analysis or opinion. We consider our audience as partners in the creation of online and digital content. We clearly identify material when that is the case. Journalism in the online and digital environments raises specific issues, arising from the speed of communication, interactivity, and the permanent and accessible nature of the material, among other characteristics. These issues are addressed in this section.",
        "Hyperlinks": "We enrich the experience of our online users by providing links from our news stories to other sites. The links reflect the pertinent views on an issue. We take reasonable steps to avoid the impression that hyperlinks included in our stories represent endorsements on our part. We ensure that links to individual businesses or organizations serve a journalistic purpose. Links to fundraising campaigns should generally not be used. We give users enough information about the site we are linking to, so they may decide whether they wish to do so.",
        "Third party Material on CBC Sites": "CBC online news pages may include material from external sites. This material is clearly labeled, noting the original source or contributor.",
        "CBC Presence on Third-party Sites": "When CBC creates profiles or accounts on third party sites like Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, MySpace or Flickr, the comments or material we place there conform to our journalistic standards and practices. To maintain the integrity of the brand, any material we publish on third party sites will be clearly branded as CBC material.",
        "Requests for Deletions": "Because much online material remains accessible indefinitely, we receive requests to remove stories by audience members who are either principals in stories, or are affected by them. We generally do not agree to requests to remove published material from our web pages. Our published content is a matter of public record. To change the content of previously published material alters that record. Altering the record could undermine our credibility and the public’s trust in our journalism. There can be exceptions to this position– where there are legal or personal safety considerations to the person named. Requests to remove material should be referred to the Director. There are other remedies to consider; correcting inaccuracies or updating a story to provide details about its resolution can often address requests for deletion.",
        "Online Surveys": "We sometimes conduct online surveys as a tool of audience engagement. Because these surveys do not fulfill the criteria set out in polling policy, the questions and the results should not be characterized as polls. We report the results by giving the number of votes cast for each option. We do not give the results as a percentage, as we normally do with bona fide polls. If programs refer to online questions, the results are reported in a way that clearly indicates it has no scientific validity and are not meant to represent the accurate range of either public opinion nor the opinion of our audience.",
        "Concealment of Identity as a Journalist": "We generally practice our reporting openly. However, there are times, while investigating a matter of public interest, a reporter will conceal his or her occupation and true purpose and pose as an ordinary citizen. We will consult with the Director before doing so. Our overriding priority will be sound public service journalism. Whatever the means used to contact a source without identifying oneself as a journalist (in person, by telephone, by email, through social networks), we will attempt to confront the source and take his or her reaction into account in our report. When the investigation bears on illegal or antisocial behaviour or abuse of trust and the gathering of information of public interest, the journalist may need to infiltrate an organization to get first-hand information. We take into account possible safety issues for the journalist involved. Before resorting to infiltration we will ensure that the following conditions are met: Any plan to infiltrate will be submitted to the Director for prior approval.",
        "Data Journalism": "Many organizations share data with the public through websites and online databases. Our Journalistic Standards and Practices apply to journalists, developers and programmers who gather, analyze, visualize and report on this data. Web scrapers can be used as a way to extract publicly available information from websites in a short time frame. When using web scrapers, we strive to be transparent toward the organization hosting the data. We also take reasonable steps to minimize any performance impact our web scrapers may have on servers and other public users of a website. When we judge it to be in the public interest, we may also decide to use clandestine methods to obtain the data (see chapter Principles – Clandestine methods). This may involve legal considerations. Before doing so, we obtain approval from the Director.",
        "Use of Social Media: Principles": "Social media like Twitter, Facebook or Snapchat can be powerful and important communication tools. They can be useful for gathering information as well as disseminating it. We are consistent in our standards, no matter what the platform, in disseminating information. If we would not put the information on air or on our own website, we would not use social media to report that information. When using social media as an information-gathering tool, we apply the same standards as those for any other source of newsgathering. We bring these principles and values to bear in our personal use of social media as well. See also: Personal Use of Social Media",
        "Interaction with the Audience": "CBC endeavours to engage with Canadians, especially on digital platforms. We promote civil discourse. When that is not being observed, our employees may consult with their supervisor about discontinuing interactions with certain individuals. When possible, we do so without unduly restricting access to our journalism.",
        "Children and Social Media": "We take care to protect the privacy of children involved in the use of social media. We are especially careful to assess the impacts when dealing with those aged 15 and under, who may lack the judgment required to consent to interviews and publication of their information. We avoid providing information that could identify them because this puts them at risk from online predators. When contacting children through their Facebook or other public sites, we follow the standards set for children’s participation applicable to all other platforms."

        "Principles": "Form is important in information programming. Production techniques contribute to the meaning of our content and its impact. They help focus attention and can facilitate understanding. Our use of production techniques is consistent with factual accuracy and fairness in our reporting. This means we make judicious choices when information content is presented with music or visual effects that could affect perception or impact. We are clear and open about the production methods we use, so the audience can put our images, sound and statements in their proper context. We advise the audience of the use of certain techniques, for example the reenactment of a scene, the use of archival material in scenes of current events or the use of clandestine methods.",
        "Form of Reporting on Litigious Subjects": "Pre-recorded material that has undergone a rigorous editorial process is generally the surest way to avoid errors in reports that could be litigious or could prejudice the reputation of a person or an organization. We may also use live on-air reporting provided all the following conditions are met:",
        "Use of Archival Material": "Illustrating a subject often requires the use of visual or audio material that we have not recorded ourselves, such as stock footage. But the use of stock footage and sound in scenes of current events must not give rise to confusion. If there is a risk of misinterpretation, we will advise the audience of the context and/or date of the archives used. The stock footage will not be used in such a way that distorts either the historical or current reality.",
        "Reconstitutions, Simulations and Generic Scenes": "A reenactment of an event must match the reality as closely as possible. When a reenactment is necessary for a proper understanding of the subject, we take care to be factually accurate, using transcriptions, minutes or official documents. We may use a transcript word for word or set the reenactment in the location where the actual scene occurred. To eliminate any risk that the audience will confuse the reenactment with the reality, we will ensure that the audience can clearly identify the reenacted scenes. Other methods of illustrating a subject may attempt to describe a situation in general terms without pretending to be a precisely accurate rendering of reality. Such methods can be used, subject to certain conditions. A simulated scene aims to evoke or give an impression of an event, its protagonists, their actions and the place where the event occurred. A simulated scene is produced and presented in a way that makes clear it is an evocation rather than a precise depiction of reality. If a risk of confusion remains, we advise the audience that the scene is simulated not real. Generic scenes are commonly used in audiovisual production. These are often everyday actions like walking, answering the phone, looking at a document, closing a door. These scenes clearly serve as general illustration and in no way pretend to describe real facts precisely.",
        "Explicit Sexual or Violent Content": "Violence, nudity and sexuality are never presented without good reason. They may be justified when they are important to an understanding of the world we live in. Where they are necessary, we present them without undue exploitation, voyeurism or sensationalism and without trivializing, encouraging or glorifying. We treat painful scenes with discretion and restraint and without prolonging them unduly. When it is necessary to present explicit content that some could find shocking, we provide an audience advisory. The same principles apply to disturbing video/audio on our digital platforms as on our conventional broadcast platforms. We strive to notify audiences in advance of them seeing such material, including – if possible – when it is seen on third-party platforms.",
        "Partnerships and Funding": "We maintain editorial independence and control over our journalistic content. The use of outside funding cannot influence that content or create the perception that the funding body or partner has any influence. If content is produced using external funding, that fact will be disclosed to the audience. Staff wanting to use outside funding to create news content or programming – including from an NGO, federal agency or professional scholarship or fellowship – will seek prior approval from the Director. There are times where for business or philanthropic purposes the CBC itself engages in partnerships with outside entities. News coverage cannot be a condition of such partnerships. If there is news coverage, it should respect the JSP, and be done in such a way that journalists involved are not endorsing an event or a product. These conditions apply as well to productions acquired by CBC. If there are any funding relationships or conditions attached, they must be fully disclosed to CBC in writing.",
        "Publicity and Advertising": "CBC does not allow sponsors to use commercial time to run information programming they have created. We are responsible for all information programming, no matter where it is placed on the schedule. CBC’s credibility and brand as an information provider must never be compromised. Information content may be accompanied by advertising or promotion. However, we do not commercially exploit the brand of our information programs and content in any way detrimental to our independence, credibility or integrity as a public service. This means that CBC's journalistic staff do not prepare or present any paid advertising content. Ads should be clearly defined in appearance and placement so that the public does not confuse them with CBC news content.",
        "Brand Protection: Fiction": "Any proposal to have journalists simulate their work in fiction, parody or advertising must be referred to the General Manager and Editor in Chief."

        "Implications and Validity of Results of Scientific Research": "We take care to understand properly and reflect the true implications of medical or scientific study results that we obtain, especially those involving statistical data. We will exercise caution with regard to results disclosed at a conference but not yet published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. In matters of human health we will take particular care to avoid arousing unfounded hopes or fears in persons living with or close to those living with serious illnesses. We will also avoid suggesting unproven benefits or risks to health related to changes in habits of consumption of food or pharmaceutical products.",
        "Reporting of Results of Sponsored Research": "When the information is available, we generally identify to the audience the sponsors of a scientific study whose results we are reporting. If the sponsor is not an academic institution, for instance an organization with commercial or other interests, and the study results favour the sponsor’s interests, we will take this into account in our treatment of the results and will advise the audience of this community of interest.",

        },
        "Principles": "Newsgathering, whether investigative or routine, lives and dies based on the quality of its sources of information. The more controversial the story, the more critical the credibility of sources becomes. Our standards apply to all types of sources, including those coming via social media, when they are used for news gathering purposes. There are two relationships at stake here – our relationship with the audience, and our relationship with the source. Sources may be risking a great deal by sharing information. It is important that we are clear and explicit from the outset as to the degree of protection we are prepared to offer and how the information will be used (e.g. \"on\" or \"off the record\"). This same clarity is necessary in our relationship with our audiences. We are clear about the relationship with the source. We let people know as precisely as possible where and from whom the information comes. This helps them evaluate that information and to put facts into context. The values of accuracy, fairness and integrity guide our handling of sources and the information they bring.",
        "Double Sourcing": "Our commitment to accuracy and integrity means we try where possible to verify the information with a second source. And there may be times when more than two sources are required. Our stories are based on information we have verified. Wherever possible, our stories use first-hand, identifiable sources – participants in an event or authenticated documents. The importance of second sourcing is influenced by the nature and quality of the primary source. If the primary source is confidential, we will, to the best of our ability, attempt to verify the accuracy of the information through independent corroboration. We will refer any decision to publish a story based on a single confidential source to the Director.",
        "Payment to Sources": "To ensure we maintain our independence, we do not pay for information from a source in a story. However, payment of fees at recognized rates to specialists for an expert report or a scientific analysis is acceptable. This is not chequebook journalism. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. Increasingly, audience members are becoming contributors; providing photos or footage of news events. As CBC does pay for freelance content, it may be appropriate, in rare circumstances, to pay for authenticated content. A decision to do so must be referred to the Director.",
        "Recording of Conversation or Pre-interview with a Source": "We often record our conversations with information sources or potential guests for note-taking purposes. This is common practice and is generally done openly, but may be done with or without the interviewee’s knowledge. Whether made with or without the source’s knowledge, recordings of conversations or pre-interviews are generally not published. We are aware that publication of this type of material could undermine a source’s confidence in journalists. It could also have legal or regulatory consequences. We accordingly take care to explore all alternatives to publication of this type of material, in keeping with our journalistic values. We will publish it only in cases when it is in the public interest and publication is the best way to ensure the accuracy, fairness and balance of our report. Any proposal to broadcast a recording made without the knowledge of the interviewee is referred to the Director.",
        "Agreements with Sources": "Our stories are based on information we have verified. Wherever possible, our stories use first-hand, identifiable sources – participants in an event or authenticated documents. Before we agree to any conditions that would limit our use of information, we are explicit about what those conditions are. We also come to agreement with the source before the information is shared. We can agree to talk to a source “off the record”, which means information cannot be used in a published form, nor can the source be named. We can also agree to publish information from a source, but without identifying that source, in one of two ways: Information obtained from confidential or anonymous sources should be verified before it is released.",
        "Protection of Sources: Granting Confidentiality": "Our ability to protect sources allows people with important information to come forward and expose matters of public interest. If we do not properly protect our confidential sources, potential sources will not trust us. This compromises our ability to expose abuses of power. We offer protection to sources based on such factors as: the potential impact and importance of the information on the lives of Canadians and its potential influence on public policy. We also consider the extent of personal or professional hardship and possible danger the source may face if his/her identity becomes known. We must make efforts to establish the source’s credibility and/or find means to corroborate the information. Once we have undertaken to protect a source, we ensure no details that could lead to identification are revealed. We are careful in the use of research material. We use the best technical tools to hide an identity for broadcast. Whenever confidentiality is granted, both the journalist and the source must be fully aware that this commitment extends to CBC as well, and is not merely limited to the journalist granting it. There may be legal implications in granting protection. Journalists should be familiar with relevant regulation or seek legal guidance. Before a confidential source is used in a story or a story is published based on the information provided, the Managing Editor must be told who the source is, and what the agreement entails. Disclosure of sources within the journalistic line of responsibility should not be confused with public disclosure of sources. Seniority of required approvals will depend upon the scope and scale of the story and its potential impact on people or institutions.",
        "Identification of Interviewees": "We are open and straightforward when we present interviewees and their statements. We make every effort to disclose the identity of interviewees and to give the context and explanations necessary for the audience to judge the relevance and credibility of their statements. In exceptional cases and for serious cause, we may decide to withhold such information in whole or in part. In such cases we explain the situation to the audience without disclosing the information that must be kept secret.",
        "Use of Leaked Documents": "Leaked documents from known or anonymous sources can provide important research for a story. When we receive leaked documents, we verify the authenticity, corroborate the information they contain, and carefully assess the motives of the person who leaked them. There are also times when the content of the documents or the fact of their existence is an important part of the story. If we have agreed to protect the identity of the person who has provided the material, we are careful that the publication of the leaked documents does not inadvertently identify the source. There may be national security or legal issues attached to the possession and publication of some leaked documents. We will take these issues into account and seek legal advice. The decision to publish leaked documents raising legal or national security concerns is referred to the General Manager and Editor in Chief.",
        "Embargos": "Persons or organizations preparing to publish the results of research or investigations will often offer us privileged access to the conclusions of their report on condition that we undertake to publish nothing of the shared content before a date set by the report’s author. This is called receiving information under embargo. A commitment to comply with the embargo may also have been made by a news agency that provides us with articles identified as embargoed. Our policy is to fulfill our embargo commitments. Prior access to a study report allows us to better prepare our reports and to do rigorous reporting work on the results, and is thus a net benefit to the quality of information we publish. Also, we need to keep our word in order to keep information flowing from our sources. However, if the embargo is violated by another media organization, we may consider publication after consulting editorial management and after informing the organization that asked for the embargo. We will inform them that the embargo has been broken and that we intend in turn to go public with the information. If we have already obtained information covered by the material under embargo, we will avoid agreeing to an embargo and will publish the information according to our own criteria of newsworthiness and at the time we consider appropriate.",
        "Data Journalism": "Many organizations share data with the public through websites and online databases. Our Journalistic Standards and Practices apply to journalists, developers and programmers who gather, analyze, visualize and report on this data. Web scrapers can be used as a way to extract publicly available information from websites in a short time frame. When using web scrapers, we strive to be transparent toward the organization hosting the data. We also take reasonable steps to minimize any performance impact our web scrapers may have on servers and other public users of a website. When we judge it to be in the public interest, we may also decide to use clandestine methods to obtain the data (see chapter Principles – Clandestine methods). This may involve legal considerations. Before doing so, we obtain approval from the Director.",
        "Verification of User Generated Content in News Stories": "CBC is responsible for all content on its news sites. This policy covers text, image, video or audio contributions from the public which are incorporated into news coverage on any platform. Material that originates from a non-CBC source is clearly identified as such. Before text, image, video or audio is published, we try to verify the information with a second source. There may be times when a third source is required. We are clear with the audience about what we do and do not know. This could include explaining the user’s relationship to the events. In exceptional circumstances, it may be difficult to authenticate a contribution. There may be times wherebecause of timelinessor as a matter of public interest, we decide to publish without full verification. The decision to publish material without full authentication must be referred to the Managing Editor. We should disclose such decisions to the audience."

        },
        "Principles": "Social media can be powerful and important communication tools. They can be useful for gathering information as well as disseminating it. We are consistent in our standards, no matter what the platform, in disseminating information. If we would not put the information on air or on our own website, we would not use social media to report that information. When using social media as an information-gathering tool, we apply the same standards as those for any other source of newsgathering. We bring these principles and values to bear in our personal use of social media as well.",
        "Verification of User Generated Content (UGC) in News Stories": "CBC is responsible for all content on its news sites. This policy covers text, image, video or audio contributions from the public which are incorporated into news coverage on any platform.

We should disclose such decisions to the audience.",
        "Concealment of Identity as a Journalist": "We generally practice our reporting openly. However, there are times, while investigating a matter of public interest, a reporter will conceal his or her occupation and true purpose and pose as an ordinary citizen. We will consult with the Director before doing so. Our overriding priority will be sound public service journalism. Whatever the means used to contact a source without identifying oneself as a journalist (in person, by telephone, by email, through social networks), we will attempt to confront the source and take his or her reaction into account in our report. When the investigation bears on illegal or antisocial behaviour or abuse of trust and the gathering of information of public interest, the journalist may need to infiltrate an organization to get first-hand information. We take into account possible safety issues for the journalist involved. Before resorting to infiltration we will ensure that the following conditions are met: Any plan to infiltrate will be submitted to the Director for prior approval.",
        "Children and Social Media": "We take care to protect the privacy of children involved in the use of social media. We are especially careful to assess the impacts when dealing with those aged 15 and under, who may lack the judgment required to consent to interviews and publication of their information. We avoid providing information that could identify them because this puts them at risk from online predators. When contacting children through their Facebook or other public sites, we follow the standards set for children’s participation applicable to all other platforms.",
        "Personal Use of Social Media": "When we use social media, we should remember two of our principles: impartiality and integrity. We recognize there are specific challenges raised because social media create an intersection of personal and professional roles and identities. With that in mind, our journalists - including casual and temporary staff as well as interns - should consider the following:",
        "Interaction with the Audience": "CBC endeavours to engage with Canadians, especially on digital platforms. We promote civil discourse. When that is not being observed, our employees may consult with their supervisor about discontinuing interactions with certain individuals. When possible, we do so without unduly restricting access to our journalism."

        "Depiction of Violence": "We reflect the reality of the situations we report. We also respect the sensibilities of our viewers, listeners and readers. Scenes of violence and suffering are part of our coverage of wars, disaster, crime and conflict. We respect our audience by assessing the impact of our images according to time of day and the context of the program where such material is appearing. If it is necessary to use graphic images, we will add a warning ahead of their use. We should familiarize ourselves with any laws or regulations about the depiction of violence.",
        "Explicit Sexual or Violent Content": "Violence, nudity and sexuality are never presented without good reason. They may be justified when they are important to an understanding of the world we live in. Where they are necessary, we present them without undue exploitation, voyeurism or sensationalism and without trivializing, encouraging or glorifying. We treat painful scenes with discretion and restraint and without prolonging them unduly. When it is necessary to present explicit content that some could find shocking, we provide an audience advisory. The same principles apply to disturbing video/audio on our digital platforms as on our conventional broadcast platforms. We strive to notify audiences in advance of them seeing such material, including – if possible – when it is seen on third-party platforms.",
        "Payment to Sources": "To ensure we maintain our independence, we do not pay for information from a source in a story. However, payment of fees at recognized rates to specialists for an expert report or a scientific analysis is acceptable. This is not chequebook journalism. In this context the payment of fees need not be reported on air. Increasingly, audience members are becoming contributors; providing photos or footage of news events. As CBC does pay for freelance content, it may be appropriate, in rare circumstances, to pay for authenticated content. A decision to do so must be referred to the Director."

        "Embedding with Military or Armed Factions": "Our conflict reporting should contribute to an understanding of the reality on the ground, and tell the stories of the combatants and the people affected by the fighting. To do this we may choose to embed with the military or another faction in the struggle, or with other interested parties. Embedding usually imposes some restrictions of movement and on our ability to record or tell stories. Reporting from an embed means that only a particular point of view is represented; we will provide balanced reporting with other perspectives and sources in a reasonable time frame. We will also be transparent with our audience about the restrictions embedding imposes. The decision to embed is an important one involving serious safety issues, as well as editorial considerations, and requires referral to the Director. Only personnel that meet CBC’s training requirements for reporting in dangerous situations can be sent on these assignments.",
        "Kidnapping": "A kidnapping presents a difficult challenge because it requires us to balance our professional duty to report what we know with the concern to protect innocent people from additional harm. A news blackout could be requested by the authorities or people involved in negotiations with the kidnappers. Decisions about respecting a news blackout or breaking one should be referred to the General Manager and Editor in Chief.",
        "Natural Disasters": "When a natural disaster strikes, we provide useful information and context, especially for those most directly affected. The information we provide helps the audience understand a fluid and chaotic situation, so that it can assess the impact and potential danger. We will sometimes receive conflicting information from credible sources. We may chosse to report this, making clear the circumstances of the situation and citing the sources while we work to reconcile the information in light of the reality on the ground.",
        "Drones": "Sometimes new technologies change the way journalists are able to gather images and information. Use of these technologies generally does not change the way we interpret our standards and practices. One such example is the use of drones. Images captured by cameras attached to drones may violate the principle of respect for privacy. Any capture or dissemination of material involving this principle should be assessed against the public interest in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy standards elsewhere in this document. Where appropriate, we may also refer to provisions for Clandestine Methods. We should be aware of legal regulations concerning the use of drones.",
        "Respect for the Suffering of Victims and their Family": "In approaching victims or witnesses of tragic events, we carefully weigh both the public interest of full reporting and the need to show compassion and restraint. In such situations we are considerate and we use judgment. We take care not to exert undue pressure on a distressed person for an interview. When images or audio clips could upset part of the audience, we choose them carefully. We limit their use to what is necessary for an understanding of the subject and we provide an audience advisory before use on any of our platforms.",
        "Identification of Accident and Crime Victims": "If police have not released the identity of a person who has died as a result of an accident or a crime, we refrain from publishing this information until we have confirmed it. If the immediate family has not been notified, we consider the public interest before identifying the victim."
